# dividing_text_data
This program takes in a long, single line of text (the textfile) and reads 80 chars of the line at a time (unless there are less than 80 chars left). The groups of at most 80 chars are stored in a properly defined struct, and then the divided 80 char chunks are printed out on separate lines.
